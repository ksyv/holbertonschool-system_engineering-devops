- For every additional element, why you are adding it?
One more sever for to provide solutions to the problems of high traffic and many SPOFs
Load balancer to distributes traffic volum to each server

- What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
The most used algorithm with HAProxy is rounRobin, which selects servers in a rotating manner, according to their weight.

- Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
The load balancer here uses an Active-Active setup so that the loads are fairly distributed between the two servers, and thus the system is fluid and not overloaded.
An active-passive setup would have used the first server while the second is on stand-by, ready to take over in the event of a problem on the first (the roles are then reversed between active and passive).

- How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
Database designed in Master/Slave mode to ensure consistency between redundant resources.
A Primary-Replica setup configures one server to act as the Primary server and the other server to act as a Replica of the Primary server. 

- What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
The master(primary) database is regarded as the authoritative source (read/write requests), the slave (replica) databases are synchronized to it.

- Where are SPOF
If one server (and its contents) goes down, the other takes over. Heavy traffic is also regulated (but not infinitely).
Now, if the server that contains the Load balancer crashes, the system is in danger.

- Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
The data transmitted over the network isn't encrypted using an SSL certificate. Anyone can intercept and read them.
There is no way of blocking unauthorized IPs since there's no firewall installed on any server. 

- No monitoring.
We have no way of knowing the status of each server since they're not being monitored.
