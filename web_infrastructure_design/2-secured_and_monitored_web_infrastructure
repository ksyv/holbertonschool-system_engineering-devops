- For every additional element, why you are adding it
Add FireWall to Load Balancer, because load balancer is the gateway between user and server, 
Add Firewall to each Server to protect it
Install SSL certificate to secure information between site and user, redirect HTTP port to HTTPS port for encrypting data.
Add a tool monitor for each server.

- What are firewalls for
Protect the network from unwanted and unauthorized users by acting as an intermediary between the internal network and the external network

- Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
The SSL certificate is for encrypting the traffic between the web servers and the external network. use 443 port.

- What monitoring is used for
 Monitoring is a set of tool to use for analysing the performance and operations of the servers, and alert administrator in problem case. 
- How the monitoring tool is collecting data
Evalue every unit in the infrastructure, consider which work metrics and resource metrics are reasonably available, and collect them all.

- Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
Install the tool Sumologic to monitor the disk I/O, MySql, Memory, Network, CPU

- Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
SSL guarantees the security of data transported by encryption

- Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
If the server that contains this database fails, it is no longer possible to write or update the data, only to read it.

- Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
The components contend for resources on the server like CPU, Memory, I/O, etc., which can lead to poor performance and also make it difficult to locate the source of the problem
